1.Kadane Algorith
	* Used to find maximum or minimum within subarry
	* used to perform subarray operations
	* O(n)
2.Segment Tree
	* bottom up approach
	* With given n nodes the height of tree is log(n)
	* Creating a tree takes _____
	* query a tree is 2*log(n)
	* update a tree log(n)
	* not good for frequent updates like deletion and adding
3.Look up Table
	* table size depends on type of problem
	* table should be built in such way that query size is always O(1)
4.Sparse Table
 	* space occupied is n*log(n)
 	* query time is O(1)
 	* table creation takes n*log(n)
5.Square root decomposition
	* space efficiency is sqrt(n)
6.Fenwick Tree
	* Time
